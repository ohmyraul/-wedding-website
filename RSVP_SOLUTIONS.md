# RSVP Form Solutions

## Current Status
Your RSVP form currently just shows a success message - it doesn't save data anywhere.

## Option 1: Formspree (Easiest - Recommended)
**Free tier:** 50 submissions/month

### Setup:
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)
5. I'll update your code to send data there
6. You'll get emails for each RSVP submission

**Pros:** Super easy, no coding needed, email notifications
**Cons:** 50 submissions/month on free tier (should be enough for a wedding!)

## Option 2: Google Forms (Very Easy)
**Free:** Unlimited submissions

### Setup:
1. Go to [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com)
2. Create a new form with same fields as your RSVP
3. Get the form URL
4. Replace your RSVP section with a link to the Google Form

**Pros:** Completely free, unlimited submissions, Google Sheets integration
**Cons:** Takes users away from your site (not as elegant)

---

## Option 3: EmailJS (Free)
**Free tier:** 200 emails/month

### Setup:
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. Sign up (free)
3. Connect your email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Create a service and template
5. I'll update your code to send emails directly

**Pros:** Emails go directly to your inbox, stays on your site
**Cons:** Requires some setup

## Option 4: Netlify Forms (If you switch to Netlify)
**Free tier:** 100 submissions/month

If you deploy on Netlify instead, they have built-in form handling.

---

## Option 5: Custom Backend (Advanced)
Set up a simple backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) to save to a database.

**Pros:** Full control
**Cons:** Requires server hosting, more complex

---

## My Recommendation: Formspree
It's the easiest and works perfectly for a wedding website. You'll get:
- Email notifications for each RSVP
- Can view all submissions in Formspree dashboard
- Easy to set up (5 minutes)
- Free for 50 submissions (plenty for a wedding!)
